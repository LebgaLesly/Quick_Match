        <p>At the beginning of the game, all the cards are mixed up and laid in columns and rows face down.
                <br>
            The Player starts and turns over two cards keeping in mind that only 9 trials are available
                <br>
            If the cards do not match (it is not a pair), they turn  back over and a trial is taken off . 
                <br>
            If the Player is unable to find a match after 9 trials then the game ends.
                <br>
            However, if the two cards match, it is a pair! He keeps the cards and no trial is taken off
                <br>
            When the players finds all the pairs, the game is over and the player wins!</p>
